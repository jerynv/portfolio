                            A simple video player that I made in my free time.
                            The player is powered by a custom video streaming backend
                            that I made in <a href="https://bun.sh">Bun JS</a>.
                            Yes this is interstellar.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            While it can play every single video format and video resolution supported by html { 1080p / 4k / 8k }, i speccifically designed the player to look sleek and comfortable, while allowing for it to support stream piped sources { in my use case torrent streams } from my servers /stream endpoint</p>

                            A simple game of

                            that I made in my free time. The game is single
                            player as it is power by AI { literally just
                            recursive min max functionality }. I made this game
                            to test my ability to make a game in a short amount
                            of time.

                            It did not take a short amount of time. On the other
                            hand though, i did find a hidden skill in being able
                            to debug recursive functions
