                        A complex school pass system that I made for my Software Development Capstone class. The backend

                        was more than happy to take on.

                        4k / 8k }, i also specifically designed the player to look sleek and comfortable, while
                        allowing for it to support stream piped sources { m3u8, hls, mp4, etc..} from any servers

                        recursive min max functionality }. I made this game
                        to test my ability to make a game in a short amount

                        It did not take a short amount of time. On the other
