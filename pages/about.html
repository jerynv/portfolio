        <h1>About me </h1>
        <p>Hi, I'm Jeryn</p>
        <p>I am a primarily self taught programmer / designer, and to put simply a fullstack developer. I prefer, and am
            primarily a backend { logistical programming } programmer, but designing frontend user experiences has
            always come naturally to me </p>
        <p>My love for solving problems is to put explicitly-undying. Coding has perfectly encapsulated the best method
            in doing so as well. It's robustness and flexibility across a multitude of languages and software draws my
            attention to coding. When I begin to envision a project or idea I get it done. Sleepless nights are a
            regular as the price for the satisfaction of solving even the smallest of problems and developing the most
            ambiguous of code is the satisfaction next to none.</p>
        <p>My story:</h1>
        <p>
            I started heavily coding as a freshman in high school, though my curiosity for building and tinkering goes
            back much further. Growing up adopted shaped me with a deep sense of independence, resilience, and an
            instinct to question the world around me. I was the kid who couldn't leave anything untouched â€” if something
            had screws, I took it apart, if it had wires, I traced where they went, if it broke, I tried to fix it. That
            curiosity never shut off, it only sharpened with time.
        </p>

        <p>
            Programming was the natural next step, the practically perfect sandbox where I could disassemble, rebuild, and create
            entire systems from scratch. The first time I realized that a few lines of code could bring an idea to life,
            I was hooked. From late night experiments to larger structured projects, I've been teaching myself not just
            how to code, but how to think in systems, patterns, and abstractions.
        </p>

        <p>
            Beyond programming, I've always loved designing things that people <em>feel</em>. Whether it's a piece of
            software, a visual interface, or even just a simple personal project, I want it to be clean, functional, and
            impactful. I've carried this tinkerer mindset into every aspect of my work and life, constantly exploring,
            questioning, and iterating. If there's a tool I don't know, I'll learn it. If there's a system I don't
            understand, I'll use all of my time until I do.
        </p>

        <p>
            Today, I consider myself not just a developer, but a builder at heart, someone who thrives on creating,
            refining, and pushing boundaries. I'm fascinated by the intersection of technology, design, and human
            experience. Every project is a chance to sharpen my craft, explore new technologies, and bring ideas that
            once lived only in my head into the real world.
