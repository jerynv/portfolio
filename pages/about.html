            <p>Hi, I'm Jeryn</p>
            <p>I am a mainly self taught programmer / designer, to put simply a fullstack developer. I prefer, and am primarily a backend { logistical programming } programmer, but designing frontend user experiences has always come naturally to me </p>
            <p>My love for solving problems is to put explicitly-undying. Coding has perfectly encapsulated the best method in doing so as well. It's robustness and flexibility across a multitude of languages and software draws my attention to coding. When I begin to envision a project or idea I get it done. Sleepless nights are a regular as the price for the satisfaction of solving even the smallest of problems and developing the most ambiguous of code is the satisfaction next to none.</p>
